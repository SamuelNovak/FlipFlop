# FlipFlop

*A group project for OxfordHack 2020.*

We created a web application that allows the user to take a selfie, locates their face (using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services) and then places it onto an animal photo. 

At the same time, it also uses the Cognitive Services to estimate user's emotion and then based on that, by using Google Maps API it suggests a place where the user can go enjoy/fix that emotion (depends if it's a positive or negative one).
